# DTProject

I tried to make some Dota 2 mechanics with UE5, all of the relevant code is written in c++, having in mind a networked/multiplayer environment, it also uses the Gameplay Ability System plugin, although this was written many months ago so I do not think it reflects my current skill level. Still it was a fun project and I think the code is not that bad.
